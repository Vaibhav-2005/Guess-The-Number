# Guess The Number
 To play, the game selects a mystery number and the player enters their initial guess. Players receive feedback on whether their guess is greater than or less than the mystery number. The player continues to make a series of educated guesses to further eliminate potential numbers until the mystery number can be solved. Guess the number in as few tries as you can. Score is given on the basis of number of guesses taken.
